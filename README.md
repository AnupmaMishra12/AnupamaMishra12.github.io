Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a simple personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It is inspired by modern parallax-style templates and is designed to showcase a clean and professional layout suitable for beginners and personal projects.

The website contains a fixed navigation bar, a hero section with a background image and logo, and an About Me section. More sections such as Portfolio and Contact can be added later to extend its functionality.
